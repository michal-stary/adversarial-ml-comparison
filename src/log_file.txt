square - 1/1 - 22 out of 147 successfully perturbed
robust accuracy after SQUARE: 62.50% (total time 2465.1 s)
Warning: Square Attack has decreased the robust accuracy of 11.00%. This might indicate that the robustness evaluation using AutoAttack is unreliable. Consider running Square Attack with more iterations and restarts or an adaptive attack. See flags_doc.md for details.
